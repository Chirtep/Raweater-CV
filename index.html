                                Work in the projects "Knowledge Base" (JS, HTML5, CSS3) and "Unified Learning Portal" (React + Redux).
                                The first solution is used by employees of the Unified Communication Center (UCC) of the Bank of Russia as part of the workflow (advising citizens on the banking and financial spheres of the Russian Federation),
                                the second is aimed at the rapid adaptation of new UCC employees in the workflow, convenient and step-by-step development of the necessary knowledge and skills.

                                As part of a team of two developers and a manager (product owner) participated in all stages of the development of the Knowledge Base project, in conditions of a limited stack (JS, HTML5, CSS3), it was
                                possible for me to implement almost all the wishes of the management and users of the project. The implementation of my suggestions to improve the work of the solution (for example, the use of web workers)
                                allowed us to significantly optimize its work and make its use by operators comfortable;

                                For the development of the "Unified Learning Portal" project, the team, after discussions, chose the stack option I proposed (React + Redux), which made it possible to improve the performance of the
                                new solution compared to the previous one, increase the readability of the code and make it easier to maintain.
